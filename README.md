## 🤖 LangGraph Agent Lab
From Zero to Production-Ready Agentic Workflows
A hands-on, structured learning repository for building agentic AI systems using LangGraph, LangChain, and Ollama.
This project is designed as a mini-course on agents — progressing from stateless graphs to memory, tools, multi-agent systems, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

---

🚀 Why This Repository?

✔ Structured like a real agent engineering course

✔ Focuses on thinking in graphs, not chains

✔ Covers state, tools, memory, and reasoning

✔ Uses local LLMs (Ollama) — no API dependency

✔ Ideal bridge from ML / LLMs → Agentic AI

---

## 🎯 Who Is This For?

This repository is ideal for:

✔️ Developers learning LangGraph

✔️ ML engineers moving into LLM agents

✔️ Engineers building RAG & AI assistants

✔️ Learners who want mental models, not magic

---

## 📚 Learning Outcomes

* After completing this repository, you will be able to:

* Design agent workflows using StateGraph

* Manage long-lived agent state and memory

* Route tool calls safely and deterministically

* Implement ReAct-style reasoning agents

* Build document drafting assistants

* Create production-style RAG pipelines

* Coordinate multiple agents in a system

## 📁 Project Structure

### 1️⃣ bot_agent.py

Minimal single-turn LangGraph agent demonstrating START → PROCESS → END flow with no memory or tools.

### 2️⃣ single_input.ipynb

Notebook version of a one-shot agent execution, useful for visually understanding graph execution.

### 3️⃣ memory_agent.py

Chat agent with persistent conversation memory, storing and reusing past user and AI messages.

### 4️⃣ sequential_input.ipynb

Handles multiple sequential user inputs using the same agent state across turns.

### 5️⃣ conditional_statements.ipynb

Demonstrates conditional routing and branching logic inside LangGraph workflows.

### 6️⃣ react_agent.py

Tool-using ReAct-style reasoning agent with strict tool invocation rules (math tools).

### 7️⃣ looping_agent.ipynb

Shows iterative / looping agent execution, where the agent reasons until a condition is met.

### 8️⃣ multiple_agent.ipynb

Implements multiple agents interacting or coordinating within a single workflow.

### 9️⃣ drafter.py

Tool-based document drafting assistant that can update and save documents autonomously.

### 🔟 rag_agent.py

End-to-end Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) agent using PDF documents and ChromaDB.

### 1️⃣1️⃣ exercise_for_graph_*.ipynb

Hands-on practice exercises to reinforce LangGraph concepts and agent design patterns.
