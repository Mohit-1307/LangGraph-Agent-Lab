## 🤖 LangGraph Agent Lab
From Zero to Production-Ready Agentic Workflows
A hands-on, structured learning repository for building agentic AI systems using LangGraph, LangChain, and Ollama.
This project is designed as a mini-course on agents — progressing from stateless graphs to memory, tools, multi-agent systems, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

---

🚀 Why This Repository?

✔ Structured like a real agent engineering course

✔ Focuses on thinking in graphs, not chains

✔ Covers state, tools, memory, and reasoning

✔ Uses local LLMs (Ollama) — no API dependency

✔ Ideal bridge from ML / LLMs → Agentic AI

---

## 🎯 Who Is This For?

This repository is ideal for:

✔️ Developers learning LangGraph

✔️ ML engineers moving into LLM agents

✔️ Engineers building RAG & AI assistants

✔️ Learners who want mental models, not magic

---

## 🧩 Course Structure

### 1️⃣ bot_agent.py

Minimal single-turn LangGraph agent demonstrating START → PROCESS → END flow with no memory or tools.

### 2️⃣ single_input_agent.ipynb

Notebook version of a one-shot agent execution, useful for visually understanding graph execution.

### 3️⃣ memory_agent.py

Chat agent with persistent conversation memory, storing and reusing past user and AI messages.

### 4️⃣ sequential_agent.ipynb

Handles multiple sequential user inputs using the same agent state across turns.

### 5️⃣ conditional_agent.ipynb

Demonstrates conditional routing and branching logic inside LangGraph workflows.

### 6️⃣ react_agent.py

Tool-using ReAct-style reasoning agent with strict tool invocation rules (math tools).

### 7️⃣ looping_agent.ipynb

Shows iterative / looping agent execution, where the agent reasons until a condition is met.

### 8️⃣ multiple_input_agent.ipynb

Implements multiple agents interacting or coordinating within a single workflow.

### 9️⃣ drafter.py

Tool-based document drafting assistant that can update and save documents autonomously.

### 🔟 rag_agent.py

End-to-end Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) agent using PDF documents and ChromaDB.

### 1️⃣1️⃣ exercise_for_*.ipynb

Hands-on practice exercises to reinforce LangGraph concepts and agent design patterns.

## ▶️ How to Run Locally

* Follow these steps to set up and run the LangGraph Agent Lab repository on your local machine

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/LangGraph-Agent-Lab.git

cd LangGraph-Agent-Lab

### 2️⃣ (Optional but Recommended) Create a Virtual Environment

#### 🪟 Windows:

python -m venv venv

venv\Scripts\activate

#### <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/MacOS_logo.svg" height="28"/> macOS / 🐧 Linux:

python3 -m venv venv

source venv/bin/activate

### 3️⃣ Install Dependencies

* Upgrade pip and install all required libraries:

pip install --upgrade pip

pip install langchain langgraph langchain-ollama langchain-chroma chromadb

### 4️⃣ Install & Set Up Ollama (Local LLMs)

* Make sure Ollama is installed and running on your system.

#### Pull the required models:

ollama pull llama3.2

ollama pull gemma:2b

ollama pull mxbai-embed-large

#### Verify Ollama is working:

ollama list

### 5️⃣ Run Python Agent Files

#### You can directly run Python-based agents:

python rag_agent.py

### 6️⃣ Run Jupyter Notebooks

#### Start Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook

#### Open and run notebooks step-by-step:

single_input.ipynb

sequential_input.ipynb

conditional_statements.ipynb

looping_agent.ipynb

multiple_agent.ipynb
